Lapaz is an asynchronous JRuby application framework using components supported by ZeroMQ, Mongrel 2
and MongoDB.

Lapaz is not finished.  It halfway through the beginning.

Four unrelated projects happened.
1) ZeroMQ
2) MongoDB
3) Llama
4) Mongrel2

Lapaz is inspired by Llama but takes the concept in a different direction using ZMQ for inter-component
communication.  ZeroMQ (ZMQ) removed the broker intermediary and simplified multi-threaded communication.
Mongrel2 went async using ZMQ to deliver requests to a handler and waiting for a reply.

It can be used to build applications or parts of applications.

Mongrel2 adds a HTTP accessibility to a Lapaz application.

It is composed of components that communicate with each other.

this is a section from a test application

route(:route_name=>"purchases") do
  from Processor::Purchases, {:seq_id=>0,:name=>'start'}
  to Consumer::Forwarder,{:seq_id=>1,:forward_to=>'prices/start',:reply_to=>'purchases/render/3.3'}
  to Processor::Contacts,{:seq_id=>1,:mux_id=>'3.1'}
  to Processor::StockItems,{:seq_id=>1,:mux_id=>'3.2'}
  to Processor::TemplateRenderer,{:seq_id=>2,:name=>'render'}
  to Processor::LayoutRenderer,{:seq_id=>3}
  to Consumer::MongrelConsumer,{:seq_id=>4}
end
